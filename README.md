# CoreBlog
A Blog built in dot net core with focus on portability and speed. 

This project follows a few simple rules, the rules are prioritized from lowest to highest.
1. The site should be able to run well on a raspberry pi as well as on a windows machine. 
2. It should be fairly easy to modify the site to fit slightly different needs.
3. The site should be very performant.
